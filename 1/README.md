# AOC Log - Day 1

Today's challenge was really easy, finding the 3 highest numbers from a list is a trivial problem.
For benchmarking purposes I will be using max heaps, even though I could simply hard code comparisons which could be faster.

The project setup was not painless, [the C++ extension for vscodium is no available due to licensing issues](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium/issues/493), so, I had to use [clangd](https://open-vsx.org/extension/llvm-vs-code-extensions/vscode-clangd) as an alternative.
