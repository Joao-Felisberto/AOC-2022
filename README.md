This repository contains all my solutions to Advent of Code 2022.

I will be taking this challenge to develop my Rust skills and learn C++.

My goal is to create both a Rust and C++ solution and trying to optimize both while I learn more of each language.

My intent here is not to provide accurate benchmarks for either language, just to learn them both.

# The twist rules

1. At the end of the day there should be a Rust and C++ solution **with time and space benchmarking**.
2. While one performs better than the other, I can perfect the worse one, even after the day has ended (for educational purposes)
